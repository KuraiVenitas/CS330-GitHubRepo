How do I approach designing software?
- When approaching the design of new software, I feel it's crucial to understand the purpose that the software serves and what decisions need to be made in order to have the software fulfill that purpose.
- For instance, the aim of this project was to recreate a scene in 3D, which required a picture, an outline for how the objects should be recreated and then week-by-week refinement of various aspects, like lighting and object positioning.

How do I approach developing programs?
- Efficiency and readability play a major part in staying organized and keeping the software running well. A question that's always at the front my mind is, "How can I make this more organized and is it efficient?". By asking this question, I'll always seek to find solutions that will benefit the program and others that choose to work on the software and need easily readable code to parse through it and implment their own solutions.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- I seek to work as a software engineer/programmer, so learning different topics involving computer science help me broaden my mindset when approaching a challenge.
- Computational graphics and visualizations can assist me greatly in the event I pick up a role that heavily involves manipulating objects within a digital environment. An example I can think of is its application in custom video game programming engines.
